            <p>
              <img alt="Most intersting man in the world" src="assets/img/content-image2.jpg"> The most important goal of effective communication is clarity. Clarity is not the same as simplicity . Often, simple things are clear if the message is intended to be brief and small, but often the message is about a complex relationship that can only be presented with a necessarily large amount of data. </p>
            <p class="alert"> This complexity can be made to appear clear by effective organization and presentation and need not be reduced to meaningless "bite-sized" chunks of data, as simplification usually does. </p>
            <p>Clarity refers to the focus on one particular message or goal at a time, rather than attempting to accomplish too much at once. Simplicity is often responsible for the "dumbing" of information rather than the illumination of it.</p>
            <h3>Questions</h3>
            <p>Please answer the following questions below. Remember to markup the information properly using HTML</p>
            <h4>Explain the difference between the &quot;alt&quot; attribute and the &quot;title&quot; attribute. </h4>
            <p> The difference between "alt" attribute and "title" attribute is that "alt" attribute provides text for an image if the image cannot be displayed and "title" attribute provides additional information about an element when the user hovers over it with the mouse.
            </p>
            <h4>Please provide an example below of how to mark up a definition from the dictionary</h4>
